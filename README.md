KinectXEFTools
=========================
Finally, a cross-platform method for extracting data from KinectStudio XEF files!
This project is based on reverse-engineering the XEF file format, documenting it for future reference, and providing tools for reading event data (loosely follows the KStudioEventReader API style) as well as an example of how to extract different stream data (e.g., RGB, depth) to disk.
